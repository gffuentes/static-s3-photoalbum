## Purpose

Above is my implementation of the [photoswipe](http://photoswipe.com/) library to create a gallery of my vacation photos. The images are stored in their full resolution on S3 and are displayed dynamically using the AWS S3 Javascript API. I also used [rmagick](https://github.com/rmagick/rmagick), a ruby implementation of [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) for image manipulation.
